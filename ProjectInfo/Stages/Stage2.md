# Stage 2:  Create sample pattern library

Create a pattern library based on the color, style, typeface that are identified in the previous stage. 

In the library please include:

- A button with text label in four states
- 4 image-based icons
- 4 other design patterns or interface elements of your choice, such as navigation buttons, a slider, buttons to confirm or cancel a user input, etc. Please be sure to label each elements.

Now lets put those components together in [Stage 3: Sketch Static interface](Stage3.md)!
