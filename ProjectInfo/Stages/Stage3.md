# Stage 3: Sketch Static interface


Putting the elements that you created in previous stage together to create 2 sample interface shows the main function of the app. The first image is expect to be the home or main page of your app, and second screen will shows the main function that you mentioned in the previous description. You can add annotation for the interaction you are expect to happened, but not too much. 

```
ðŸš© Nice Job! You just walk through pre-design and static sketch process! Right now your vision about the appâ€™s function and look should be solid enough and lets move our static sketches into Figma to add interaction to make it looks like a real app!
