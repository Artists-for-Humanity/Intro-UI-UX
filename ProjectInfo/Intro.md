# Application Design Project

## Introduction:

As you already gone through the introduction presentation, you should have some kinds of sense about the visual components of the UI/UX Design. Now you have a chance to apply those theories and ideas into practice by creating an app concept brief with the topic that you are interested in. 

You will go through several assignments that align with the essential project development process towards the final result. 

Although you are free to choose the topic that you are interested in, there are some limitation that needs to be set which will reduce some efforts of identifying function. 

feel free to explore resources website like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net) to gain inspirations! Design is all about referencing and inspiring!

You will choose from following functional topic:

- heartbeat monitor
- app help find food
- time management
- remote control for home appliances(Laundry machine, light bulb…)

No matter what app you choose, you should be able to answer the following questions about your product:

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Where will it live? On a smartphone, website, computer, or...?

---
❗Be specific, don’t say it is for general publics, which is not helpful for you to make right design decision, try to narrow down to certain group of audiences.  

---

Try to keep your app simple, there shouldn’t be too much functions so that you are able to present main function in two sample screens.

You don’t need to think about realistic right now, which means you don’t need to worry about wether the function of the app will be about to develop or not. What we are focusing on right now is the visual present of the interface.
